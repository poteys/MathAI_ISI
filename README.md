# Repository mathematiques pour jeux video, mai 2021 #
Repository for all my exercises that includes the projects in my portfolio

# Exercise Algorithm A*
In this project I had to realize an A* algorithm with the C++ programming language. The goal was to define the shortest path, despite the different walls that act as obstacles between the starting point which corresponds to the first square and the end point which corresponds to the mouse pointer.

# Exercise behavior tree
The goal of this project was to realize an intelligent behavior using a behavior tree with the C++ programming language.
Our object (in blue) had to find its final destination which is updated each time it reaches it (the red point).


# Moving Boids
Project consisting in creating boids that are able to follow the mouse pointer at a certain speed.
Project realized with the C++ language.
